# Data-Driven Discovery of Discrete-Time Recurrences

This repository explores how **discrete-time dynamical systems** can be modeled and interpreted from noisy time-series data using machine learning methods.

## Problem Statement
Given multiple noisy univariate sequences generated by unknown autonomous systems, the goal is to:
- Predict future states from past observations
- Identify compact analytical recurrence relations
- Analyze stability, residuals, and model parsimony

## Approach
- Strict chronological train/validation/test splits
- Supervised learning using history vectors
- Models implemented:
  - Linear Auto-Regressive (AR)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Key Analysis
- History length selection based on validation performance
- Comparison of black-box predictors vs analytical recurrences
- Residual analysis and long-horizon forecasting behavior
- Parsimony–accuracy and stability trade-offs
